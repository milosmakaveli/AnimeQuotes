# AnimeQuotes
AnimeQuotes is a React.js web app that displays random quotes from various anime. The app relies on a simple backend server built with Express.js, which fetches both a random anime quote and an associated anime image. The app uses two APIs: AnimeChan for the quotes and Jikan for the anime images.


# Features
- Random Anime Quotes: Displays random quotes from various anime, along with the character who said each quote.
- Dark/Light Mode: Toggle between dark and light modes, with settings that persist even after a browser refresh.
- Quote Animation: Smooth animations when displaying a new random quote.
- AnimeChan API Integration: The app currently fetches quotes using the free AnimeChan API, which is limited to 20 requests per hour.
